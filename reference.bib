abstract="A denotational semantics and a Hoare programming logic for a subset of the standard hardware description languageVHDL are set out here. Both define the behaviour of synchronously clockedVHDL simulators in declarative and compositional style. The logic is proved complete with respect to the denotational semantics and a natural implementation of the logic inPROLOG as a validation condition generator forVHDL is also described.",
